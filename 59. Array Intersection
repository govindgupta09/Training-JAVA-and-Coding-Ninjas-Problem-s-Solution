'''
Array Intersection

You have been given two integer arrays/list(ARR1 and ARR2) of size N and M, respectively. You need to print their intersection; An intersection for this problem can be defined when both the arrays/lists contain a particular value or to put it in other words, when there is a common value that exists in both the arrays/lists.

Note :
Input arrays/lists can contain duplicate elements.

The intersection elements printed would be in the order they appear in the first array/list(ARR1


Sample Input 1 :

2 6 8 5 4 3
2 3 4 7 

10 10
10

Sample Output 1 :
2 4 3
10
